## About Me

After a successful career in sales and management inthe luxury travel industry, I decided it was time for a change. I wanted my next role to be one that would never go stale and where every day would bring new opportunities to better myself and improve on my skills.

Reflecting on my strengths and my motivations, a career in Software Development felt like the most natural path and within 3 weeks of making that decision, I applied and was accepted into Makers Academy. 

My experience at Makers has strengthened my commitment to improvement and learning and I have graduated with more than just skills in writing code, key industry practices like TDD and an agile development process. I have learned how to learn, how to methodically solve problems and how to manage my own well-being.
