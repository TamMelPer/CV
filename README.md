## About Me

After a successful career in sales and management in the luxury travel industry, I decided it was time for a change. I wanted my next role to be one that would never go stale and where every day would bring new opportunities to better myself and improve on my skills.

Reflecting on my strengths and my motivations, a career in Software Development felt like the most natural path and within 3 weeks of making that decision, I applied and was accepted into Makers Academy. 

My experience at Makers has strengthened my commitment to improvement and learning and I have graduated with more than just skills in writing code, key industry practices like TDD and an agile development process. I have learned how to learn, how to methodically solve problems and how to manage my own well-being.

## About My Skills

### Communication:
In Sales, you need strong listening skills along with written and verbal communication skills to win new clients and retain existing clients. I also polished these skills by writing training manuals which I delivered to my team and the wider company resulting in quick, seamless adoption of new ways of working. At Audley Travel, I conducted weekly 1-1s and quarterly reviews with my direct reports and made monthly presentations to the Head of Sales and to HR, communicating clearly and concisely on performance. 

### Detail-Oriented: 
My ability to quickly spot errors in cost and sale prices resulted in my teams consistently having the lowest write-offs. Proofreading and editing brochures and personalised itineraries has sharpened this skill over the years. When writing code in pairing sessions and group projects I am often quick to spot when a comma has been missed, a method has been spelt incorrectly or an ‘end’ is in the wrong place saving frustration down the line.

### Flexible and Adaptable: 
The travel industry is a cyclical business where no two days are the same, and I have regularly had to pivot my priorities and strategies to  handle operational incidents like the bankruptcy of an airline, closing of a hotel, or a change in FCO advice. My flexibility and adaptability, along with my positive attitude to change, has seen me redeployed to support various different departments. Most recently I coordinated the repatriation of clients from India and Sri Lanka as borders started shutting down due to the pandemic and successfully brought all clients back to the UK within 48 hours.

## About My Experience

_Regional Sales Manager_

- Carried out key people management processes including recruitment, appraisals, performance management, coaching and development. My specialists always qualified for the annual Top Performers event, which recognised the best in sales in the company.

- Utilized tools like Tableau to analyze data on sales and service performance. Set and monitored individual monthly, quarterly and yearly targets which were realistic and achievable but also stretched my specialists. 
- Promoted a culture of learning and development within my department and owned projects that focused on up-skilling, product knowledge and training on new systems and processes. As a result, my team consistently met or exceeded KPIs.
